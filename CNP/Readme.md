Here,I have shown 3 losses where the model is trained with Hyperparameters as
  1.) Iterations : 8k
      Learning Rate : 1e-4
  2.) Same iteration
      Learning Rate : 1e-5
  3.) Iteration : 9k
      Learning Rate : 1e-6

From the plots,we can see that, the minimum loss y-point is in 1st plot but not converges (iteration is low), in 3rd plot, as lr is v.small,it though converges ,the minimum loss we can see is nearly 1.3
