This repository documents my work during my internship at IIT Gandhinagar (SRIP).
Project Overview

The focus of my internship is on Neural Processes, a class of models that enable flexible and efficient learning from sparse data. Neural Processes have shown great promise in various applications, including image completion, time series forecasting, and few-shot learning.
Goals

During this internship, my primary objectives are:
  
    Understand the theoretical foundations of Neural Processes.
    Implement Neural Processes using PyTorch.
    Explore different variants and extensions of Neural Processes.
    Use Neural Process for air quality prediction

Progress

Currently learning about GNP(though having some doubts for which I am learning GNN a bit)
I will be regularly updating this repository with my progress, including code implementations, experimental results, and relevant findings.
